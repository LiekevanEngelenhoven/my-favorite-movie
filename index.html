            <h3>Bill Murray</h3>
        <p class="p2">Vincent MacKenna is a retired, grumpy, alcoholic Vietnam War veteran living in Sheepshead Bay, who
            smokes and gambles regularly. His wife, Sandy, developed Alzheimer's years ago and can no longer recognize
            him, but he poses as a doctor to visit her and does her laundry. Vincent's only close friends are his cat
            Felix and a pregnant Russian sex worker named Daka. Despite his aggressive attitude toward strangers,
            Vincent has acquaintances who admire and care about him.</p>
